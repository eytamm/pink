            <h1>Brain Damage</h1>

            <p class="lyrics">
                The lunatic is on the grass <br>
                The lunatic is on the grass <br>
                Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs <br>
                Got to keep the loonies on the path <br>
                The lunatic is in the hall <br>
                The lunatics are in my hall <br>
                The paper holds their folded faces to the floor <br>
                And every day the paper boy brings more <br>
                And if the dam breaks open many years too soon <br>
                And if there is no room upon the hill <br>
                And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too <br>
                <strong>'ll see you on the dark side of the moon</strong> <br>
                The lunatic is in my head <br>
                The lunatic is in my head <br>
                You raise the blade, you make the change <br>
                You re-arrange me 'til I'm sane <br>
                You lock the door <br>
                And throw away the key <br>
                There's someone in my head but it's not me <br>
                And if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear <br>
                You shout and no one seems to hear <br>
                And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes <br>
                I'll see you on the dark side of the moon <br>
            </p>
